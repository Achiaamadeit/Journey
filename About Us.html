<p div class="Team"> GET TO KNOW ABOUT OUR STORY📖🖋️</p> </div>
<p>Rhythm of Faith was born from a shared passion for both dance and faith. It started wa group of dancers who wanted to create a space where movement and spirituality could  intersect—where we could inspire one another to grow, not only as dancers but as individuals connected by our beliefs.</p>
<p > The Journey Started in 2022 where a  group of passionate dancers gathered one Saturday.Each had a unique style,but shared a commom dream.
 They merged gtheir styles,creating a beautiful fusion.Their differences became strengths forging an unbreakable bond.
They practiced,perfectrd and performed as one.Their hardwork paid off,wowing
audiences everywhere.

    <p>They named themselves "Rhythm🎶Of Of🔻Faith🎶" because they believed each 
rhythm  that came out with a movw was achieved through faith and dedication.
We mostly performed at church programs and musical events.We dance to celebrate, worship, and praise God through the 
leading of the Holy Spirit. Movement has power to stir the senses and emotions and convey a message that cannot be expressed through words alone, so our ministry interprets selected songs to 
express God's messages to His people.</p>
